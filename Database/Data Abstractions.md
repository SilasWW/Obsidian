In database management, the three levels of data abstraction—conceptual, logical, and physical—each use different types of models or representations to define the structure and organization of data. Here are the key models used in each level:

1. **Conceptual Level**:
    
    - **Entity-Relationship (ER) Model**: This is the most common model used at the conceptual level. It represents data in terms of entities and the relationships between these entities. An entity represents a real-world object or concept, and the relationships describe how these entities interact with each other.
    - **UML Class Diagrams**: Although more common in software engineering, UML (Unified Modeling Language) class diagrams can also be used to represent entities and relationships in a database context.
2. **Logical Level**:
    
    - **Relational Model**: This is the most widely used model at the logical level. It represents data in tables (relations), with rows (tuples) and columns (attributes). The relational model focuses on how data is structured and relates to other data.
    - **Object-Oriented Data Model**: This model represents data as objects, similar to object-oriented programming. It's useful for applications that require a tight integration with object-oriented programming languages.
    - **Semantic Data Model**: This model focuses on the meaning of the data and its relationships, providing a more conceptual representation than the relational model.
3. **Physical Level**:
    
    - **File-Based Data Models**: These include specific details about how data is stored in the computer's physical storage, such as file formats, indexing methods, and data clustering.
    - **Indexed Sequential Access Method (ISAM)**: This is a method for indexing data for fast retrieval.
    - **B+ Tree Index Files**: B+ Trees are commonly used as an index structure in databases to enhance data retrieval speed.
