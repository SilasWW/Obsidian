Atomicity in database design refers to the practice of structuring data in such a way that it is stored in the smallest useful form. This concept is crucial for ensuring data integrity, simplifying queries, and facilitating updates and maintenance.

Examples:
1. Break names into first and last names, so they can be queried and analysed separately
2. Break addresses down into sub-parts
