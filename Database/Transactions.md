A transaction in a database context is indeed an operation, or a series of operations, that adheres to the ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) properties. These properties ensure that the database remains reliable and robust, especially in environments where multiple transactions are occurring simultaneously or where system failures might happen.

- **Atomicity**: Guarantees that a transaction is treated as a single, indivisible unit, which means either all its operations are completed successfully, or none are.
    
- **Consistency**: Ensures the database remains in a valid state before and after the transaction, respecting all predefined rules, constraints, and schema definitions.
    
- **Isolation**: Provides a mechanism where the operations in a transaction are hidden from other transactions until the transaction is completed, preventing data corruption caused by concurrent transactions.
    
- **Durability**: Assures that once a transaction has been committed, it will remain so, even in the case of a system failure, ensuring data persistence.
